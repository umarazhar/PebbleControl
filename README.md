# PebbleControl

An android app that works with my pebble application to control essentially anything orientation based.

<b>How To Use</b>

The pebble app communicates with the android phone for data transfer. From there it can be sent to any device or even used locally by the phone. The test application that I used was a car simulation on the computer. Just wear the pebble watch on your hand and pretend to drive a car with a steering wheel. The car turns appropriately in response to the angle of rotation of the "steering wheel".
